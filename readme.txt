Assignment:

Implement an Address Book that holds the name and phone numbers of your friends.
The Address Book should have functions to add, remove and edit contacts plus a function to print the list of friends and their corresponding phone numbers sorted by their name.
Optional task: If you can complete the following task along with the above tasks it will prove that you are a star.

Given another address book that may or may not contain the same friends, print out the list of friends that are unique in either address book.
You do not need to build a GUI or a full blown application just a simple console based application will do. Your work should display evidence of good object oriented design principles, high quality code and tests. Use of the Spring framework and unit tests are expected.
